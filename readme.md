BruinBridge is a web app that hopes to bridge the gap between prospective UCLA students and current UCLA students. It gives prospective students a chance to better interact with current UCLA students through a forum and one-on-one mentoring. Our aim is to give prospective students a more personal and in-depth experience without having to visit campus.

## Technology Stack
We used React.js for the front-end UI components, and connected it to Google Firestore, which acts as our database and host.
