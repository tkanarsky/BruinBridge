# BruinBridge

BruinBridge will be a web app that hopes to bridge the gap between prospective students who are interested in coming to UCLA and current UCLA students. It will give prospective students a chance to better interact with current UCLA students through forums and interviews, and provide opportunities for one-on-one mentoring. Our aim is to give prospective students a more personal and in-depth experience by matching them with a current student.

## Features
Our main feature will be the q&a forum and the 1:1 chat between mentors/mentees. 
The landing page will consist of a UCLA background with 2 simple buttons: ‘Sign up’ and ‘Log in.’ When signing up, mentors will have to create an account with their Ucla email. High schoolers will have the option to be matched with a mentor based on their prospective major and interests. When the user scrolls down, the q&a forum will be available to anyone to read, but if the user would like to post/comment, they must sign in or create an account. We will have a navigation bar at the top of the screen, with buttons for the home page, Q&A, and My Mentor/My Mentee. There will also be a profile button on the right side of the nav bar. Our main focus will be the 1:1 mentorship between prospective students and current UCLA students. Ideally, the current UCLA student will help answer any questions the prospective student has, and guide them towards becoming a future Bruin.

If there was more time, we would expand this to other colleges besides UCLA. This way, prospective students can have mentors from different colleges they are interested in. We would also build a feature that allows prospective students to compare their college choices and help them make a decision on where to go.

## Technology Stack
We will use React.js for the front-end UI components, connecting to a backend Flask or Node.js server over a REST API. User data will be stored in MongoDB or Google Firebase, and we’ll host the server in Google Cloud (using free trial credits!) or Heroku (small monthly fee). To collaborate with each other, we will be using Git, which will allow us to work on the project on our own local machines with reliable version control, and Figma to draw up mock-ups for our pages.

## Timeline	
We will split up into separate groups for frontend and backend. Our first actions will be to create a git repo, produce a preliminary design, and implement a way for students and mentors to create accounts and login. Then we will work on creating a general forum and matching students to mentors. We will be in communication with a Messenger group chat, along with occasional Zoom meetings.
